This is a fork of Andreas M. Br√¶ndhaugen's [Lever code generator](https://andreasmb.github.io/lever-jobs-embed/). It provides an excellent, quick way to load jobs from Lever into content management systems like Wordpress. The CSS in this fork has been customised to better reflect that in use on the [Soho Strategy](https://www.sohostrategy.com/) [careers website](https://www.sohostrategy.com/careers/).
